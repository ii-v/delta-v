# delta-v
`delta-v` is a program to calculate [Delta-V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta-v) (*Î”V*). Made specifically for [Kerbal Space Program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerbal_Space_Program), but may be used for other purposes.

It is currently under heavy development and many things will change in the near future. Feel free to give some tips or ideas!

## compiling
To run the program, do the following:

  1. `git clone https://github.com/ii-v/delta-v.git`
  2. `cd delta-v`
  3. `make`
  4. Run the program with `./delta-v`
  5. Optional: Install the program with `sudo make install` and uninstall with `sudo make uninstall`

If this for some reason doesn't work for you, compile manually with `gcc -o delta-v delta-v.c -lm` and run with `./delta-v`
The program has only been tested on Ubuntu 16.04, but should work on other systems.

## usage
When compiled, the program is very simple to use. Just run it, and answer the prompts.

If you are unsure what any of the prompts mean, please consult Wikipedia or the KSP Wiki.
